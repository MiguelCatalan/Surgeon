# Surgeon

##What is this?
**For the Android developers that love to split the strings files, will have to suffer when they have to add translations.** It is hard to know if there is a new string searching in each file for each translation.

Surgeon it is a simple script that finds all the string files, merges them and compares each translation to find the differences. Finally generates a new file with the missing translation in each language.

##How do I use it?
Just place the script in the proyect directory, **at the same level of the app** directory, and execute it in the terminal:

	python surgeon.py
	
##Don't be shy
Pull requests are welcome. Lets put this newbie surgeon to the top of the wall of fame.
